        <h1>A future where everyone has a healthy, sustainable diet.</h1>
        <p>We work to help change the food environment through strategic critique, product reformulation, training and advice, and helping corporate nutritionists to make the case for healthier, more sustainable products.<p />
          <p> In collaboration with others, we advocate to change the food environment especially in schools and care settings, promoting the importance of nutrition on school attendance and attainment, campaigning for the most vulnerable to have access to free school meals and holiday clubs, and to appropriate nutrition in care homes and in supported living environments.</p>
          We educate people directly through marketing and communications campaigns; we work with schools reaching parents, teachers and the wider school community via the Food - a fact of life programme and through our flagship Healthy Eating Week </p>
